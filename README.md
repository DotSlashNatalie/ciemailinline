Codeigniter email class with inline attachments

How to use
============

- If you want to display an image inline, it must be attached (simple enough using email->attach($file))
- Like with everything, no email service was created equalâ€¦even though we have RFCs (see my screen shots of hotmail, gmail, and yahoo. Note that yahoo violates, imo, the unspoken rule of auto-loading attached images but yet not auto-loading non-attached images)
- To reference an attached image in your HTML page, use cid:filename.ext, note the cid:

Yes, I know this should extend the CI email class instead of overwriting it. Please don't complain about that. I personally don't use codeigniter any more (for a couple of reasons - namely I've made my own, and codeigniter is no longer being supported). If you want to fix it to extend the CI_Email class - it would be better if you forked this repo versus a pull request.
This was made as a quick feature integration to a site which had a CI version that would really never change.

I release this to the world in the hopes that it would be helpful to someone.
